"""A class loader that will load C or Python implementations of the PO class
depending on the USECPO variable.

Use the environment variable USECPO=2 (or 1) to choose the C implementation which
uses Gettext's libgettextpo for high parsing speed.  Otherise the local
Python based parser is used (slower but very well tested)."""
