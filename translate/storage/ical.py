"""Class that manages iCalender files for translation.

iCalendar files follow the `RFC2445 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2445>`_
specification.

The iCalendar specification uses the following naming conventions:

- Component: an event, journal entry, timezone, etc
- Property: a property of a component: summary, description, start time, etc
- Attribute: an attribute of a property, e.g. language

The following are localisable in this implementation:

- VEVENT component: SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, COMMENT and LOCATION properties

While other items could be localised this is not seen as important until use
cases arise.  In such a case simply adjusting the component.name and
property.name lists to include these will allow expanded localisation.

LANGUAGE Attribute
    While the iCalendar format allows items to have a language attribute this is
    not used. The reason being that for most of the items that we localise they
    are only allowed to occur zero or once.  Thus 'summary' would ideally
    be present in multiple languages in one file, the format does not allow
    such multiple entries.  This is unfortunate as it prevents the creation
    of a single multilingual iCalendar file.

Future Format Support
    As this format used `vobject <http://eventable.github.io/vobject/>`_
    which supports various formats including
    `vCard <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard>`_ it is possible to expand
    this format to understand those if needed.
