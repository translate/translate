Translate Toolkit 1.12.0-rc1
****************************

*Not yet released*

This release contains many improvements and bug fixes. While it contains many
general improvements, it also specifically contains needed changes and
optimizations for the upcoming `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`_

It is just over a X months since the last release and there are many
improvements across the board.  A number of people contributed to this release
and we've tried to credit them wherever possible (sorry if somehow we missed
you).

Major changes
-------------
- PHP format adds a number of new features

Formats and Converters
----------------------

- PHP:

  - Warn about duplicate entries
  - Allow blank spaces in array declaration (:bug:`2646`)
  - Support nested arrays (:bug:`2240`)

- Mozilla properties

  - If a unit has an associated access key entry then these are combined into a
    single unit, as done in the :doc:`Mozilla DTD </formats/dtd>` format

- DTD

  - The ``&amp;`` entity is automatically expanded when reading DTD files, and
    escaped back when writing them

General
-------
- Added some functional tests
- Removed the translate.misc.diff_match_patch module, in favour of the one
  hosted on PyPI.
- The `Six <https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_ module is now a required dependency.

...and loads of internal changes to improve maintainability, remove unused
imports, remove unused code and general code cleanups, some changes to ensure
future Python 3 portability and of course many many bugfixes.
