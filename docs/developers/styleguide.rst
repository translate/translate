Translate Styleguide
====================

The Translate styleguide is the styleguide for all Translate projects,
including Translate Toolkit, Pootle, Virtaal and others.  Patches are required
to follow these guidelines.

This Styleguide follows :pep:`8` with some clarifications. It is based almost
verbatim on the `Flask Styleguide`_.


.. _styleguide-python:

Python
------

These are the Translate conventions for Python coding style.

.. _styleguide-general:

General
^^^^^^^

Indentation
~~~~~~~~~~~

4 real spaces, no tabs. Exceptions: modules that have been copied into the
source that don't follow this guideline.


Maximum line length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

79 characters with a soft limit for 84 if absolutely necessary. Try to avoid
too nested code by cleverly placing `break`, `continue` and `return`
statements.


Continuing long statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To continue a statement you can use backslashes (preceeded by a space) in which
case you should align the next line with the last dot or equal sign, or indent
four spaces:

.. code-block:: python

    MyModel.query.filter(MyModel.scalar > 120) \
                 .order_by(MyModel.name.desc()) \
                 .limit(10)

    my_long_assignment = MyModel.query.filter(MyModel.scalar > 120) \
                         .order_by(MyModel.name.desc()) \
                         .limit(10)

    this_is_a_very_long(function_call, 'with many parameters') \
        .that_returns_an_object_with_an_attribute


If you break in a statement with parentheses or braces, align to the braces:

.. code-block:: python

    this_is_a_very_long(function_call, 'with many parameters',
                        23, 42, 'and even more')


If you need to break long strings, on function calls or when assigning to
variables, try to use implicit string continuation:

.. code-block:: python

    this_holds_a_very_long_string("Very long string with a lot of characters "
                                  "and words on it, so many that it is "
                                  "necessary to break it in several lines to "
                                  "improve readability.")
    long_string_var = ("Very long string with a lot of characters and words on "
                       "it, so many that it is necessary to break it in "
                       "several lines to improve readability.")


For lists or tuples with many items, break immediately after the opening brace:

.. code-block:: python

    items = [
        'this is the first', 'set of items', 'with more items',
        'to come in this line', 'like this'
    ]


Blank lines
~~~~~~~~~~~

Top level functions and classes are separated by two lines, everything else
by one. Do not use too many blank lines to separate logical segments in code.
Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def hello(name):
        print 'Hello %s!' % name


    def goodbye(name):
        print 'See you %s.' % name


    class MyClass(object):
        """This is a simple docstring"""

        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

        @property
        def annoying_name(self):
            return self.name.upper() + '!!!!111'


.. _styleguide-imports:

Imports
~~~~~~~

Like in :pep:`8`, but:

- Imports should be grouped in the following order:

  1) __future__ library imports
  2) Python standard library imports
  3) Third party libraries imports
  4) Translate Toolkit imports
  5) Current package imports, using explicit relative imports (See `PEP 328
     <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#guido-s-decision>`_)

- A blank line must be present between each group of imports (like in PEP8).
- Imports on each group must be arranged alphabetically by module name:

  - Shortest module names must be before longer ones:
    ``from django.db import ...`` before ``from django.db.models import ...``.

- ``import ...`` calls must precede ``from ... import`` ones on each group:

  - On each of these subgroups the entries should be alphabetically arranged.
  - No blank lines between subgroups.

- On ``from ... import``

  - Use a ``CONSTANT``, ``Class``, ``function`` order, where the constants,
    classes and functions are in alphabetical order inside of its respective
    groups.
  - If the import line exceeds the 80 chars, then split it using parentheses to
    continue the import on the next line (aligning the imported items with the
    opening parenthesis).

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import absolute_import

    import re
    import sys.path as sys_path
    import time
    from datetime import timedelta
    from os import path

    from lxml.html import fromstring

    from translate.filters import checks
    from translate.storage import versioncontrol
    from translate.storage.aresource import (EOF, WHITESPACE, AndroidFile,
                                             AndroidUnit, android_decode,
                                             android_encode)

    from . import php2po


Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

- Never use ``lambda`` functions:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    @property
    def stores(self):
      return self.child.stores


    # Bad.
    stores = property(lambda self: self.child.stores)


- Try to use ``@property`` instead of ``get_*`` or ``is_*`` methods that don't
  require passing any parameter:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    @property
    def terminology(self):
      ...

    @property
    def is_monolingual(self):
      ...


    # Also good.
    def get_stores_for_language(self, language):
      ...


    # Bad.
    def get_terminology(self):
      ...

    def is_monolingual(self):
      ...


- Always use ``@property`` instead of ``property(...)``, even for properties
  that also have a setter or a deleter:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    @property
    def units(self):
      ...


    # Also good.
    @property
    def x(self):
      """I'm the 'x' property."""
      return self._x

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):  # Note: Method must be named 'x' too.
      self._x = value

    @x.deleter
    def x(self):  # Note: Method must be named 'x' too.
      del self._x


    # Bad.
    def _get_units(self):
      ...
    units = property(_get_units)


    # Also bad.
    def getx(self):
      return self._x
    def setx(self, value):
      self._x = value
    def delx(self):
      del self._x
    x = property(getx, setx, delx, "I'm the 'x' property.")


Single vs double quoted strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no preference on using single or double quotes for strings, except in
some specific cases:

- Always use single quotes for string dictionary keys:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    demo = {
        'language': language,
    }


    # Bad.
    demo = {
        "language": language,
    }


- When a single or double quote character needs to be escaped it is recommended
  to instead enclose the string using the other quoting:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    str1 = "Sauron's eye"
    str2 = 'Its name is "Virtaal".'


    # Bad.
    str3 = 'Sauron\'s eye'
    str4 = "Its name is \"Virtaal\"."


Expressions and Statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General whitespace rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- No whitespace for unary operators that are not words (e.g.: ``-``, ``~``
  etc.) as well on the inner side of parentheses.
- Whitespace is placed between binary operators.

.. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    exp = -1.05
    value = (item_value / item_count) * offset / exp
    value = my_list[index]
    value = my_dict['key']


    # Bad.
    exp = - 1.05
    value = ( item_value / item_count ) * offset / exp
    value = (item_value/item_count)*offset/exp
    value=( item_value/item_count ) * offset/exp
    value = my_list[ index ]
    value = my_dict ['key']


Slice notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While :pep:`8` calls for spaces around operators ``a = b + c`` this results in
flags when you use ``a[b+1:c-1]`` but would allow the rather unreadable
``a[b + 1:c - 1]`` to pass. :pep:`8` is rather quiet on slice notation.

- Don't use spaces with simple variables or numbers
- Use brackets for expressions with spaces between binary operators

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    a[1:2]
    a[start:end]
    a[(start - 1):(end + var + 2)]  # Brackets help group things and don't hide the slice
    a[-1:(end + 1)]


    # Bad.
    a[start: end]  # No spaces around :
    a[start-1:end+var+2]  # Insanely hard to read, especially when your expressions are more complex
    a[start - 1:end + 2]  # You lose sight of the fact that it is a slice
    a[- 1:end]  # -1 is unary, no space


.. note::

   String slice formatting is still under discussion.

Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Against arbitrary types: ``==`` and ``!=``
- Against singletons with ``is`` and ``is not`` (e.g.: ``foo is not None``)
- Never compare something with `True` or `False` (for example never do ``foo ==
  False``, do ``not foo`` instead)


Negated containment checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use ``foo not in bar`` instead of ``not foo in bar``


Instance checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``isinstance(a, C)`` instead of ``type(A) is C``, but try to avoid instance
  checks in general.  Check for features.


If statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use ``()`` brackets around complex if statements to allow easy wrapping,
  don't use backslash to wrap an if statement.
- Wrap between ``and``, ``or``, etc.
- Keep ``not`` with the expression
- Use ``()`` alignment between expressions
- Use extra ``()`` to eliminate ambiguity, don't rely on an understanding of
  Python operator precedence rules.

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good.
    if length >= (upper + 2):
        ...

    if (length >= 25 and
        string != "Something" and
        not careful):
        do_something()


    # Bad.
    if length >= upper + 2:
        ...

    if (length...
        and string !=...


Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   This has not been implemented or discussed.  The Translate code
   is not at all consistent with these conventions.


- Class names: ``CamelCase``, with acronyms kept uppercase (``HTTPWriter`` and
  not ``HttpWriter``)
- Variable names: ``lowercase_with_underscores``
- Method and function names: ``lowercase_with_underscores``
- Constants: ``UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES``
- precompiled regular expressions: ``name_re``

Protected members are prefixed with a single underscore.  Double underscores
are reserved for mixin classes.

To prevent name clashes with keywords, one trailing underscore may be appended.
Clashes with builtins are allowed and **must not** be resolved by appending an
underline to the name.  If your code needs to access a shadowed builtin, rebind
the builtin to a different name instead.  Consider using a different name to
avoid having to deal with either type of name clash, but don't complicate names
with prefixes or suffixes.


Function and method arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Class methods: ``cls`` as first parameter
- Instance methods: ``self`` as first parameter


.. _styleguide-docs:

Documentation
=============

We use Sphinx_ to generate our API and user documentation. Read the
`reStructuredText primer`_ and `Sphinx documentation`_ as needed.


Special roles
-------------

We introduce a number of special roles for documentation:

* ``:bug:`` -- links to a bug in Translate's Bugzilla.

  * ``:bug:`123``` gives: :bug:`123`
  * ``:bug:`broken <123>``` gives: :bug:`broken <123>`

* ``:opt:`` -- mark command options and command values.

  * ``:opt:`-P``` gives :opt:`-P`
  * ``:opt:`--progress=dots``` gives :opt:`--progress=dots`
  * ``:opt:`dots``` gives :opt:`dots`

* ``:man:`` -- link to a Linux man page.

  * ``:man:`msgfmt``` gives :man:`msgfmt`


Code and command line highlighting
----------------------------------

All code examples and format snippets should be highlighted to make them easier
to read.  By default Sphinx uses Python highlighting of code snippets (but it
doesn't always work).  You will want to change that in these situations:

.. highlight:: rest

* The examples are not Python e.g. talking about INI file parsing.  In which
  case set the file level highlighting using::

     .. highlight:: ini

* There are multiple different code examples in the document, then use::

    .. code-block:: ruby

  before each code block.

* Python code highlighting isn't working, then force Python highlighting using::

    .. code-block:: python

.. note:: Generally we prefer explicit markup as this makes it easier for those
   following you to know what you intended.  So use ``.. code-block:: python``
   even though in some cases this is not required.

With bash *command line examples*, to improve readability use::

    .. code-block:: bash

Add ``$`` command prompt markers and ``#`` comments as required, as shown in
this example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd docs
   $ make html  # Build all Sphinx documentation
   $ make linkcheck  # Report broken links


.. highlight:: python


User documentation
------------------

This is documentation found in ``docs/`` and that is published on Read the
Docs. The target is the end user so our primary objective is to make accesible,
readable and beautiful documents for them.


Docstrings
----------

Docstring conventions:
  All docstrings are formatted with reStructuredText as understood by
  Sphinx.  Depending on the number of lines in the docstring, they are
  laid out differently.  If it's just one line, the closing triple
  quote is on the same line as the opening, otherwise the text is on
  the same line as the opening quote and the triple quote that closes
  the string on its own line:

  .. code-block:: python

    def foo():
        """This is a simple docstring."""


    def bar():
        """This is a longer docstring with so much information in there
        that it spans three lines.  In this case the closing triple quote
        is on its own line.
        """


Please read :pep:`257` (Docstring Conventions) for a general overview,
the important parts though are:

- A docstring should have a brief one-line summary, ending with a period. Use
  ``Do this``, ``Return that`` rather than ``Does ...``, ``Returns ...``.
- If there are more details there should be a blank line between the one-line
  summary and the rest of the text.  Use paragraphs and formatting as needed.
- Use `reST field lists`_ to describe the input parameters and/or return types
  as the last part of the docstring.
- Use proper capitalisation and punctuation.
- Don't restate things that would appear in parameter descriptions.

.. code-block:: python

    def addunit(self, unit):
        """Append the given unit to the object's list of units.

        This method should always be used rather than trying to modify the
        list manually.

        :param Unit unit: Any object that inherits from :class:`Unit`.
        """
        self.units.append(unit)


Parameter documentation:
  Document parameters using `reST field lists`_ as follows:

  .. code-block:: python

    def foo(bar):
        """Simple docstring.

        :param SomeType bar: Something
        :return: Returns something
        :rtype: Return type
        """


Cross referencing code:
   When talking about other objects, methods, functions and variables
   it is good practice to cross-reference them with Sphinx's `Python
   cross-referencing`_.

Other directives:
   Use `paragraph-level markup`_ when needed.

.. note::

   We still need to gather the useful ones that we want you to use and how to use
   them.  E.g. how to talk about a parameter in the docstring.  How to reference
   classes in the module.  How to reference other modules, etc.


Module header:
  The module header consists of an utf-8 encoding declaration, copyright
  attribution, license block and a standard docstring:

  .. code-block:: python

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    #
    ... LICENSE BLOCK...

    """A brief description"""

..    """
        package.module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..        A brief description goes here.

..        :copyright: (c) YEAR by AUTHOR.
        :license: LICENSE_NAME, see LICENSE_FILE for more details.
    """

Deprecation:
  Document the deprecation and version when deprecating features:

  .. code-block:: python

     from translate.misc.deprecation import deprecated


     @deprecated("Use util.run_fast() instead.")
     def run_slow():
         """Run fast

         .. deprecated:: 1.5
            Use :func:`run_fast` instead.
         """
         run_fast()



Comments
--------

General:
  - The ``#`` symbol (pound or hash) is used to start comments.
  - A space must follow the ``#`` between any written text.
  - Line length must be observed.
  - Inline comments are preceded by two spaces.
  - Write sentences correctly: proper capitalisation and punctuation.

  .. code-block:: python

    # Good comment with space before and full sentence.
    statement  # Good comment with two spaces


    #Bad comment no space before
    statement # Bad comment, needs two spaces


Docstring comments:
  Rules for comments are similar to docstrings.  Both are formatted with
  reStructuredText.  If a comment is used to document an attribute, put a
  colon after the opening pound sign (``#``):

  .. code-block:: python

    class User(object):
        #: the name of the user as unicode string
        name = Column(String)
        #: the sha1 hash of the password + inline salt
        pw_hash = Column(String)

String formatting
-----------------

While str.format() is more powerful than %-formatting, the latter has been the
canonical way of formatting strings in Python for a long time and the Python
core team has shown no desire to settle on one syntax over the other.
For simple, serial positional cases (non-translatable strings), the old "%s"
way of formatting is preferred.
For anything more complex, including translatable strings, str.format is
preferred as it is significantly more powerful and often cleaner.

.. code-block:: python

    # Good
    print("Hello, {thing}".format(thing="world"))
    print("%s=%r" % ("hello", "world"))  # non-translatable strings

    # Bad
    print("%s, %s" % ("Hello", "world"))  # Translatable string.
    print("Hello, %(thing)s" % {"thing": "world"})  # Use {thing}.
    print("Hello, {}".format("world"))  # Incompatible with Python 2.6. Use %s.
