Standard conformance
====================

Summary: `TMX version 1.4
<http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/tmx/tmx14b.html>`_ conformance to
Level 1, except that no markup is stripped.

* All required header fields are supplied.
* The adminlang field in the header is always English.
* None of the optional header fields are supplied.
* We assume that only two languages are used (source and single target
  language).
* No special consideration for segmentation.
* Currently text is treated as plain text, in other words no markup like HTML
  inside messages are stripped or interpreted as it should be for complete
  Level 1 conformance.
