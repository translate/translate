Wordfast Translation Memory
***************************

The Wordfast format, as used by the `Wordfast
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordfast>`_ translation tool, is a simple tab
delimited file.

The storage format can read and write Wordfast TM files.

.. _wordfast#conformance:

Conformance
===========

* Escaping -- The format correctly handles Wordfast ``&'XX;`` escaping and will
  unescape and escape seamlessly.
* Soft-breaks -- these are not managed and are left as escaped
* Replaceables -- these are not managed
* Header -- Only basic updating and reading of the header is implemented
* Tab-separated value (TSV) -- the format correctly handles the TSV format used
  by Wordfast.  There is no quoting, Windows newlines are used and the ``\t``
  is used as a delimiter (see :bug:`472`)
