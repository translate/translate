TBX requirements by Galician translation team (Proxecto Trasno)
***************************************************************

Here you have a list of `TBX requirements
<http://www.certima.net/glosima/?28-xustificacion-das-escollas-de>`_ needed by
the `Galician translation team (Proxecto Trasno) <http://www.trasno.net>`_. Its
translation to english is below. You can see a terminology management system
software specification draft in
http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/developers/terminology_management_system

A very important feature is to allow the exporting using pretty printing (like
in the first example below) since the exported glossaries should be able to be
read both by humans and software.

Before the example you can see a list priorizing the features from more
interesting and needed to less interesting and needed.

The chosen TBX tags are determined by the needs of our terminology management
system (the galician translation team one). That terminology management system
needs several glossaries, each glossary has several concepts, and each concept
can have several definitions (only one definition per language in a given
concept), and also can have several translations for each concept (several
translations per language in a given concept). The concepts will also have
associated some links to get more information (several links per language in a
given concept). Also is needed to have defined several languages.

Now we have a list of all the needed entities lets go with the list of
attributes for each of that entities:

Each glossary has a name and a description.

Each concept has an unique id, a subject field (which is another concept in the
same glossary), it can have several concepts that people may wish to see (lets
call it related concepts), and it can also have a parent concept (broader
concept).

Each link has a type (image, Wikipedia page,...), the address of the link, and
a tiny description.

Each definition has a definition text.

We want to save the ISO 639 code of each language.

Each translation can have a translation text, it has an unique id, the part of
speech, the grammatical genre (if applicable), the grammatical number (if
applicable), a field that indicates if the translation is an abbreviation or an
acronym, an explaining note, examples of use (created by the people that make
the terminology), links to examples of real use (a corpus or translation
database), a field that indicates if the translation is completed or if it is
still incomplete (completion status), and we also need to save the translation
administrative status (if it is a recommedend translation, a not recommended
one, or if it is a forbidden translation) and the reason why the translation
has the actual administrative status (a simple text string) that only applies
when the administrative status is other than "recommended".

Once listed the needs we proceeded with reading the TBX ISO 300042 standard in
search of the elements that support these needs, and we found at least one tag
(or attribute) for every need, except for only a few that doesn't have. We
should comment that TBX stores the information grouping it by concepts, and
within each concept part of the information is stored at the beginning of the
concept and other part of that information (the language-dependant information)
is splited between the different languages, and within every language section
it is splited another time between the translations of that language. This way
it has a three level structure: concept level, language level and translation
level (also called term level).

Next we list the needs and the tag chosen for that need, indicating the level
in which the tag goes:

* **Glossary name:** if we match glossary with TBX file, then the glossary name
  is the TBX file title, the label <title>. It goes on the file header.

* **Glossary description:** if we match glossary with TBX file then we can use
  a <p> tag inside <sourceDesc> tag. It goes on the file header.

* **Concept:** the <termEntry> tag from TBX standard represents a concept. This
  tag encloses the concept level.

* **Concept identifier:** the <termEntry> tag has an attribute named "id".

* **Concept subject field:** the TBX standard defines the <descrip> tag with
  "subjectField" in its "type" attribute to represent the concept subject field
  (***<descrip type="subjectField">subject field name</descrip>***). Since
  there is no way to refer to another concept we should use some of the
  translations of the subject field concept (the concept that is the subject
  field of the current concept) to put inside the subject field tag. It goes in
  concept level. **The lack of a way in TBX standard to refer to another
  concept within the same glossary as subject field to make self-contained
  glossaries is a real lack or we haven't identified the way to do this using
  TBX??**

* **Related concepts:** the TBX standard suggest the use of the tag ***<ref
  type="crossReference" target="cid­23">some text...</ref>*** where “cid­23” is
  the value of the related concept id, and "some text..." is one of the related
  concept translations (the first english recommended one, for example). It
  goes on concept level.

* **Broader concept:** TBX defines the use of the tag <descrip> with the value
  "broaderConceptGeneric" in its "type" attribute and a text between its
  opening and closing tags. Also it allows the use of the "target" attribute to
  refer to the broader concept. It goes on concept level. Example ***<descrip
  type="broaderConceptGeneric" target="cid­23">broader concept
  name</descrip>***

* **Link:** according to TBX standard the tag that defines external links to
  outside the current file is the <xref> tag. This tag has the following
  structure: ***<xref type="xGraphic" target="sports/cricket/bat.jpg">cricket
  bat</xref>*** where "type" is the link type, "target" is the link address and
  the text between the opening and closing tags is a short description. It goes
  on language level.

* **Link type:** the <xref> tag has an attribute named "type" that defines the
  link type. This attribute can have the values "xGraphic" if it is an image,
  "externalCrossReference" if it is a link to an external resource (for example
  a link to Wikipedia). It can have other values, but for now they are
  considered not important.

* **Link address:** the <xref> tag has an attribute named "target" which is the
  link address.

* **Link description:** the link description can go between the opening and
  closing tags

* **Definition:** to save the definitions it should be used the <descrip> tag
  with the value "definition" in its "type" attribute. It goes on the language
  level. Example: ***<descrip type="definition">alternate name for a
  person...</descrip>*** can be the definition for "nickname".

* **Definition text:** the definition text goes between the opening and closing
  <descrip> tags.

* **Language:** in TBX the <langSet> tag represents a language, but no language
  list is stored inside the TBX file. So if there is a <langSet> tag for a
  given language somewhere inside the TBX file, then this particular language
  is defined in that TBX file. Inside each concept only can exist one <langSet>
  per language, but a given language can have a <langSet> in each <termEntry>.
  It is essential that at least one <langSet> tag is present in every
  <termEntry> tag. The <langSet> tag encloses the language level. It goes on
  concept level.

* **Language code:** the <langSet> tag has an attribute named "xml:lang" which
  stores some ISO 639 code value. Example: ***<langSet xml:lang="gl">***

* **Translation:** the TBX standard defines two different tags to enclose the
  translation level: <tig> and <ntig>. The <tig> tag provides all the needed
  functionalities, like also the <ntig> tag does, but the <ntig> also has a lot
  of undesired and unnecessary functionalities that complicate the TBX file
  structure in an unnecessary way making its size grow and making dificult to a
  person read the file with a text editor. Besides the TBX-Basic standard only
  uses the <tig> tag. So we decided to only use the <tig> tag.

* **Translation text:** the translation text goes between the opening and
  closing of the <term> tag that goes on the translation level (under the <tig>
  tag). Example: ***<term>nickname</term>***

* **Translation identifier:** the <tig> tag has an attribute named "id" in
  which we put the identifier. Example: ***<tig id="tid­59">...</tig>***

* **Part of speech:** for storing the part of speech TBX suggests the use of
  the <termNote> tag indicating in the "type" attribute the value
  "partOfSpeech". The TBX standard doesn't defines a part of speech values list
  (like noun, verb...), but the TBX-Basic standard (a simplified subset of TBX)
  defines a short list of part of speech values which we can reuse and that can
  be completed if necessary. It goes on translation level. Example:
  ***<termNote type="partOfSpeech">noun</termNote>***

* **Grammatical gender:** TBX specifies that the grammatical gender should be
  specified using the <termNote> tag indicating the value "grammaticalGender"
  in the "type" attribute. Like in the previous point, TBX doesn't define a
  gender list so we will have to use the defined in TBX-Basic. It goes on the
  translation level. Example: ***<termNote
  type="grammaticalGender">masculine</termNote>***

* **Grammatical number:** TBX says that for saving the grammatical number it
  should be used a <termNote> tag with the value "grammaticalNumber" in its
  "type" attribute. For the grammatical number we are going to use the list
  defined in TBX-Basic. The grammatical should only be put when not putting it
  could lead to misunderstanding. It goes on the translation level. Example:
  ***<termNote type="grammaticalNumber">plural</termNote>***

* **Acronym:** to indicate that a translation is an acronym we can use the
  <termNote> tag with the "termType" value on its attribute "type" and the text
  "acronym" between its opening and closing tags. It goes on the translation
  level. Example: ***<termNote type="termType">acronym</termNote>***

* **Abbreviation:** Like in the previous point but putting now "abbreviation"
  between the opening and the closing tags. It goes on the translation level.

* **Translation explaining note:** for the notes TBX defines the use of the
  <termNote> tag with the value "usageNote" on its "type" attribute with the
  explanatory note text between its opening and closing tags. It goes on the
  translation level. Example: ***<termNote type="usageNote">Don't abuse of that
  translation...</termNote>***

* **Example of use:** for the examples of use made ad hoc we are going to use
  the <descrip> tag with the value "context" on its "type" attribute and the
  example text between its opening and closing tags. It goes on the translation
  level. We are not going to use <descrip type="sampleSentence"> since it
  doesn't appear both in TBX and in TBX-Basic, and also we are not going to use
  <descrip type="example"> since in it is not mandatory to include the
  translation text in the example. Example: ***<descrip type="context">example
  text</descrip>***

* **Link to real use example:** it is used for references to corpus
  (translations databases, like open-tran.eu). TBX says that such references
  should be indicated using the <xref> tag with the value "corpusTrace" on its
  "type" attribute. It goes on the translation level. Example: ***<xref
  type="corpusTrace" target="http:*en.gl.open-tran.eu/suggest/window">Window on
  open-tran.eu</xref>**//

* **Completion status:** we are going to use the <termNote> tag with the value
  "processStatus" in its "type" attribute and the text "provisionallyProcessed"
  between its opening and closing tags to indicate that not all the translation
  information is not approved or that some of that information are not included
  on the system yet. In case being completed this tag shouldn't appear, despite
  TBX defines the values "unprocessed" and "finalized". It goes on the
  translation level. Example: ***<termNote
  type="processStatus">provisionallyProcessed</termNote>***

* **Administrative status:** to indicate the administrative status of the
  translation we are going to do the way TBX specifies and not how TBX-Basic
  does since we are using a superset of TBX-Basic. TBX specifies the use of the
  <termNote> tag with the value "administrativeStatus" on its "type" attribute
  and the text that indicates the status between its opening and closing tags.
  TBX defines a list of several states but we are only going to use three of
  them: "preferredTerm­admn­sts" to indicate that this is a recommended
  translation, "admittedTerm­admn­sts" to indicate that it is a valid
  translation but that be prefer not to use it since there is another one that
  is recommended, and "deprecatedTerm­admn­sts" to indicate that this
  translation is forbidden (for not being a valid translation for a given
  language for some reasons: false friend,...). It goes on the translation
  level. Example: ***<termNote
  type="administrativeStatus">preferredTerm­admn­sts</termNote>***

* **Administrative status reason:** TBX doesn't define any way to save the
  reason why a translation has a given administrative status. Due to that we
  decided to use the <note> tag for specifying the reason. Since this tag is
  also used for saving notes we are considering to use the <termNoteGrp> to
  group it together with the administrative status tag. Maybe some languages
  are not going to use that, but in galician it is very very important. Note
  that the reason is not specified if the administrative status is
  "preferredTerm­admn­sts". It goes on the translation level. Example:
  **galicism**

each level. Click on the image to enlarge.

    d'exécuter des programmes enregistrés. C'est un ensemble de circuits électroniques permettant de manipuler des données sous forme 
    binaire, ou bits. Cette machine permet de traiter automatiquement les données, ou informations, selon des séquences d'instructions 
    prédéfinies appelées aussi programmes.
                            Elle interagit avec l'environnement grâce à des périphériques comme le moniteur, le clavier, la souris, 
    l'imprimante, le modem, le lecteur de CD (liste non-exhaustive). Les ordinateurs peuvent être classés selon plusieurs critères 
    (domaine d'application, taille ou architecture).</descrip>
