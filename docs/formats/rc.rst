Windows RC files
****************

.. versionadded:: 1.2

Windows .rc files, or resource files, are used to store translatable text,
dialogs, menu, etc. for Windows applications.  The format can be handled by the
Translate Toolkit :doc:`/commands/rc2po` and po2rc.

.. _rc#conformance:

Conformance
===========

The actual specification of .rc files is hard to come by.  The parser was built
using `WINE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_%28software%29>`_ .rc files as
a reference.  This was done as WINE is a good target for .rc translations.  We
are confident though that the extraction will prove robust for all .rc files.
