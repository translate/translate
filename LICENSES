Other licenses

--------

This is used by tmserver. Depending on the whole of CherryPy was overkill for
just needing this server component.

License: BSD copy in translate/misc/wsgiserver/LICENSE.txt

Used in: translate/misc/wsgiserver/*

From: CherryPy 3.2.4
https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/C/CherryPy/CherryPy-3.2.4.tar.gz#md5=e2c8455e15c39c9d60e0393c264a4d16
