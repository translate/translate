# D300 - Use """triple double quotes"""
#
# Default OFF
# D202 - No blank lines allowed after function docstring (found 1)

# D203 - 1 blank line required before class docstring
#   - incompatible with D211
#
# Temporary OFF - needs more time to fix

# E129 visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
#   - No real agreement here.  Best to disable it for now
# E226 missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
#   - This makes split[a+1:b+1] look unreadble as split[a + 1:b + 1]
# E402 module level import not at top of file
#   - There are enough cases where we want to import in a function
# W503 line break before binary operator
#   - Jury is out on what is actualy more readable
# E731 do not assign a lambda expression, use a def
#   - Not sure this is really correct, till then its off
# Future cleanups, temporary disabled
# E501 line length
#   - Way too much noise
# E265 block comment should start with '# '
# E266 too many leading '#' for block comment
#   - Way too much noise, likely commented out code
#   - Not something to cleanup just yet
# E741 ambiguous variable name
#   - Require some thought to cleanup
